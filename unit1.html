    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction to Computer</h2>
        <p>A computer is an electronic device derived from the Latin word "computere," which means to calculate. It accepts raw facts and figures as input through input devices, processes them according to user commands, stores the data before and after processing, and produces meaningful information as output through output devices. Generally, computers work on the IPO (Input-Process-Output) cycle and follow the GIGO (Garbage In Garbage Out) principle, meaning the output is always based on the input supplied by the user.</p>
        <p>The basic operation of a computer is illustrated by the following block diagram:</p>
