    <h1>Operating System - Introduction</h1>
    <p>An operating system (OS) is an integrated set of programs that controls overall resources such as CPU, memory, and input-output devices of the computer system. The major objective of the operating system is to improve the performance and efficiency of a computer system. Like the manager of a company, an operating system is responsible for the smooth and efficient functioning of the entire computer system. The operating system provides the platform for other application programs/software to run and execute. It provides users with an interface so that users can easily communicate with computers, which is more convenient to use and operate.</p>

    <p>An operating system is a collection of programs that controls the overall operation of the computer system. It also controls and coordinates the use of hardware among various application programs for various users. So, it acts as an interface between users and computer hardware. The other major functions of an operating system are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It controls, monitors, and coordinates the overall operation of the computer system.</li>
        <li>It acts as an interface between the user and the computer.</li>
        <li>It provides a platform to develop, run, and execute other computer programs.</li>
        <li>It manages hardware resources such as CPU, memories, input-output terminals, networking equipment, etc.</li>
        <li>It hides programming and hardware complexity from the user.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The primary goal of an operating system is to maximize the productivity of a computer system by operating it in the most efficient manner while minimizing human intervention. Some examples of operating systems are MS-DOS, Windows, Linux, MacOS, UNIX, Chrome, Fedora, Ubuntu, etc.</p>

    <h2>Functions / Features / Advantages of Operating System (OS)</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Input-Output (I/O) Management:</strong> Allows computer to interact with peripheral devices like keyboard, mouse, printer, scanner, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>User Interface (UI):</strong> Provides an ideal environment where users can interact with the computer system. There are two types of user interfaces:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Character/Command User Interface (CUI):</strong> E.g., MS-DOS</li>
                <li><strong>Graphical User Interface (GUI):</strong> E.g., Windows, MacOS</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> Protects against threats such as viruses, unauthorized access, etc., through built-in tools like user authentication and password protection.</li>
        <li><strong>Process Management:</strong> Allocates the CPU to execute a chosen process, managing job scheduling, process scheduling, and dispatching.</li>
        <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> Allocates memory to load programs and data into RAM and frees up memory when the program terminates.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Management:</strong> Organizes data into logical groupings called files, allowing efficient storage and retrieval.</li>
        <li><strong>Command Interpreter:</strong> Interprets user commands and translates them into actions the computer can execute.</li>
        <li><strong>Dead-Lock Prevention:</strong> Ensures that resources are allocated properly to prevent deadlock situations in processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Time Sharing:</strong> Allows the CPU to allocate time among multiple users on the same computer system.</li>
        <li><strong>Virtual Memory:</strong> Compensates for a shortage of physical memory by using space on secondary storage like hard drives.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Types of Operating System (OS)</h2>
    <h3>A) On the basis of Processing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Multi-programming OS:</strong> Executes multiple user programs simultaneously using a single processor.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-tasking OS:</strong> Runs multiple programs concurrently in a single-user system.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiprocessing OS:</strong> Uses multiple processors to run programs simultaneously, improving execution speed.</li>
        <li><strong>Time-Sharing OS:</strong> Allows multiple users to share CPU time and provides quick responses.</li>
        <li><strong>Batch Processing OS:</strong> Groups similar jobs together to be executed in sequence.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-threading OS:</strong> Divides a process into smaller threads that can be executed concurrently.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-Time OS:</strong> Provides quick processing for critical tasks, ensuring tasks complete in a predefined time.</li>
        <li><strong>Online Processing OS:</strong> Processes transactions as they happen in real-time, allowing for user interaction during processing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B) On the basis of User Interface (UI)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Character User Interface (CUI):</strong> Involves interaction with the system through commands typed by the user (e.g., MS-DOS, UNIX).</li>
        <li><strong>Graphical User Interface (GUI):</strong> Involves interaction through graphical elements like icons, windows, and menus (e.g., Windows, MacOS).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C) On the mode of user</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Single User:</strong> OS developed for a single user at a time (e.g., MS-DOS).</li>
        <li><strong>Multi User:</strong> OS developed for multiple users to access a single system at the same time (e.g., Linux, UNIX).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Some important Operating Systems in use</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Open Source Operating System:</strong> Source code is freely available for modification and redistribution (e.g., Linux, UNIX).</li>
        <li><strong>UNIX:</strong> A powerful multi-user, multi-tasking OS developed by AT&T Bell Labs in the 1970s.</li>
        <li><strong>Linux:</strong> An open-source OS based on UNIX, widely used for server systems and available in different distributions (e.g., Red Hat, Ubuntu).</li>
        <li><strong>MacOS:</strong> A GUI-based OS used in Apple computers with high-quality graphical interface.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Some Terminologies related to OS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Spooling:</strong> A process to handle the difference in speed between CPU and slow peripheral devices like printers.</li>
        <li><strong>Process:</strong> A program in execution. It can be in a running, ready, or blocked state.</li>
        <li><strong>Thread:</strong> A smaller sub-process of a larger program that can run concurrently with others.</li>
        <li><strong>Scheduling:</strong> The OS's process of deciding which process to run next (e.g., priority scheduling, time-sharing scheduling).</li>
        <li><strong>Buffering:</strong> Using a small, high-speed storage device to hold data during I/O operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Virtual Memory:</strong> Uses secondary storage to supplement primary memory when running multiple programs simultaneously.</li>
    </ul>
