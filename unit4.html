  <h3>Cell reference in Excel (V.imp)</h3>
  <div class="note">
  <p>A cell location in a spreadsheet is referred to as its cell reference. To find a cell reference, simply look at column heading to find which column the cell is in and across to find which row it is in. The cell reference is a combination of column letter and row number such as A1, B3, Z9 … When writing cell reference the column letter should always comes first. Specially cell reference is very important while writing formula or addressing the cell to evaluate the cell. For eg, if we want to add values 3 and 2 which are in A1 and A2 respectively, instead of writing A3=3+2 we write A3=A1+A2</p>
  </div>
  <h4>Types of cell reference</h4>

  <h4>Relative cell reference:</h4> <p>In excel, a relative cell reference identifies the location of the cell or group of cell. Cell reference are used in formula, functions, charts and other excel commands. By default a spreadsheet cell reference is relative cell reference. This means, the formula and functions can be copied and posted to other cell. A relative cell consist of column letter and row number and intersect at the cell location, An example of relative cell reference would be A1, B4, G9 etc.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
  <h4>Absolute cell reference:</h4> <p>In Excel, an absolute cell reference identifies the location of cell or group of cell which also contain column letter and row number surrounded by dollar sign($). An example of absolute cell reference would be $A$2, $G$9, $Z$345 etc. An easy way to add dollar sign us to click on cell reference and then press “F4” key from keyboard. An absolute cell reference is use when you want a cell reference to stay fixed on a specific cell, which means formula and functions can be copied and posted to other cell the formula and function doesn't change.</p>
