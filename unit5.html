  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>As we know every computerized device does not work by itself. They needed to be given some sort of command that makes computer work. These commands helps to instruct computer and program specific action required by the user. Since the command are given in the form of computer language, we need programming language are used to write the set of instruction which commands the computer to perform certain action collectively called programs. These programs are again integrated in order to make a complete software. Simply software is the collection of different interrelated program which performs specific function.</p>
  <p>Program Written in any type of programming language are not understood by the computer hence we need some sort of language translator or processor such as assembler, complier and interpreter which has the basic function of converting program written in any type of language into machine level language.</p>
  <p>The program written by the programmer is known as source program. After converting it becomes program.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
  <h2>Qualities of good programs</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>It should be easily understood.</li>
  <li>A program should be correct; it should be error free.</li>
  <li>It should be reliable.</li>
  <li>It should have easily understandable user interface.</li>
  <li>It should be portable and flexible.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
  <h2>Programming Language</h2>
  <p>In order to make communication between user and computer, we need a computer language that helps user to generate commands to perform as per the requirement. This language with which we can give instruction to the computer is known as <strong>programming language</strong>. Programming language are the set of different keywords, variables, operators, loops, and other entities using different character sets including numbers, special symbol and alphanumeric values.</p>
  <p>Hence, the process of writing the programming language is known as <strong>programming</strong> and the person who writes program is <strong>programmers</strong>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
  <h2>Types of Programming Language</h2>
  <p>There are several types of programming language which can be categorized as follows:</p>

  <div class="subsection">
  <h3>1. Low level language</h3>
  <p><strong>Low level language</strong> are the machine dependent language which means program written for one type of system cannot be run in another system. Developer should have detail analysis and knowledge about the system for which s/he is going to write a program for. Hence, programming in low level language is very much difficult and time consuming. Different types of programming language are:</p>

  <div class="subsection">
  <h4>a. Machine level language(1GL)</h4>
  <p>This language consists a sequence of 0’s and 1’s to generate instruction. Since, it uses binary numbers, this type of language is directly understood by processor. So, it has higher execution speed. It is also a machine dependent language in which programmers should have detailed knowledge of the system.</p>
  <div class="subsection">
  <h4>Advantage:</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>It is directly understood by the processor so execution speed is relatively high.</li>
  <li>Language translator or processor is not needed.</li>
  <li>They can be used to program specific purpose computer.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
  <h4>Disadvantage:</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>It is difficult and time consuming to develop and debug program.</li>
  <li>It is machine dependent language. So, program developed for one system cannot be operated in another system.</li>
  <li>All the syntax and commands are in the form of binary numbers which is difficult to remember.</li>
  <li>Programmers should have detail knowledge about particular system and its architecture.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  </div>

  <div class="subsection">
  <h4>b. Assembly language(2GL)</h4>
  <p><strong>Assembly language</strong> are also an example of low-level language. In this language, instead of writing instruction in the series of 0’s and 1’s we can use mnemonics (symbolic instructions) like ADD, SUB, RST, DIV, MOD and so on. Since it is closer to machine level language, a programmer should have detailed knowledge about computer internal architecture. This language is faster in comparison to high level language. Since, this language is not directly understood by the computer, we need language translator like assembler to convert it into machine level language.</p>
  <div class="subsection">
  <h4>Advantage:</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>It is easier to write, debug and understand programming written in assembly level language compared to machine level language.</li>
  <li>Program execution is higher compared to high level language,</li>
  <li>Since they are machine dependent, they are used to develop different device drivers.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
  <h4>Disadvantage:</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>It is machine dependent language, i.e. program made for one processor doesn’t run in another processor.</li>
  <li>Use of mnemonics code makes assembly language much more complex.</li>
  <li>Program development and debugging is more difficult and time consuming compared to high level language.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  </div>
  </div>

  <div class="subsection">
  <h3>2. High level language</h3>
  <p>This language is close to English language. High level language code is written in English like structure using mathematical notation. Since it is similar to English language, it is easier to develop and debug the program. It is machine independent language (i.e. program developed for one processor can work on another processor). Since HLL (high level language) are not directly understood by the computers, we need language processor or translator such as complier and interpreter for converting program written in high level language to machine level language. FORTAN (Formula Translator) introduced on 1956 A.D is the first high level language. Nowadays there are many high-level languages like C, C++, python, JavaScript, etc.</p>
  <div class="subsection">
  <h4>Advantage:</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Since it is closer to English language, program written in this language is easier to write, debug and understand.</li>
  <li>Since it is machine independent, program written for one processor can work in another processor.</li>
  <li>Programmer doesn’t have to remember large number of mnemonics and other unusual codes.</li>
  <li>Program development is faster and requires less effort than other language.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
  <h4>Disadvantage:</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Computer doesn’t understand high level language directly. So the program needs conversion before execution.</li>
  <li>Program execution is slower compared to low level language.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="subsection">
  <h4>High level language can further be classified into:</h4>
  <div class="subsection">
  <h4>a. Procedural oriented Language(3GL)</h4>
  <p>This type of language is high level language which primarily focuses on procedure rather than on data. Hence, they are used to express the logic and the procedure of the program. Since it focuses only on procedure, it is complex and time consuming to write a large program. This type of language follows top to bottom approach i.e. main function is written at the bottom of the program. This type of language doesn’t pose important and powerful feature like data encapsulation, data inheritance, data extraction and so on. So, this type of language has less security compared to object-oriented language. Because of their flexibility, procedure language is able to solve verities of problem. Examples: C, FORTAN, QBasic, etc.</p>
  <div class="subsection">
  <h4>Advantage:</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Program development and debugging is easier compared to low level language.</li>
  <li>More advance and user-friendly software can be developed.</li>
  <li>It is also a machine independent language.</li>
  <li>It is used as general purpose programming.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
  <h4>Disadvantage:</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Language translator or processor is required to execute the program.</li>
  <li>Program execution is slower.</li>
  <li>Data security is less in comparison to other high-level language.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  </div>

  <div class="subsection">
  <h4>b. Problem/object Oriented Language(4GL)</h4>
  <p>This is the advance form of high-level language which primarily focuses on data rather than procedure. It allows the user to specify what the output should be without describing all the detail (i.e. procedure) of how the data should be manipulated. This type of language follows bottom up approach. That means all main function are written at the bottom of the program whereas classes and object are described at top of the program. Since it has several powerful features such as data encapsulation, data extraction and inheritance, the data are more secure compared to procedure language. Examples: C#, C++, Java, etc.</p>
  <div class="subsection">
  <h4>Advantage:</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Web based application and software can be developed.</li>
  <li>More advance and user-friendly software can be developed.</li>
  <li>It is also machine independent language.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
  <h4>Disadvantage:</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Language translator is required to execute the program.</li>
  <li>Program execution is slower.</li>
  <li>It is difficult to develop hardware-oriented language.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  </div>

  <div class="subsection">
  <h4>c. Natural Language (5GL)</h4>
  <p>Natural language uses simple statement of common communication language where we could write statements that would look like normal sentences. It is still in developing stage; computer scientists are working hard for developing such language. However, programming language like PROLOG (programming logic) is currently in use. For example: - instead of writing some unusual code, programmers would write: “who are the salesmen who has sold more than 30,000 products last month?”</p>
  <div class="subsection">
  <h4>Advantage:</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>It will be even easier to develop and debug the program.</li>
  <li>It will also be machine independent language.</li>
  <li>More advance and user-friendly program will be made.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
  <h4>Disadvantage:</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Language translator is required to execute the program.</li>
  <li>Program execution is slower</li>
  <li>It is difficult to develop hardware-oriented language.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  </div>
  </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
  <h2>Language translator/processor</h2>
  <p><strong>Language translator</strong> is that system development software which helps to convert program written in assembly or high-level language (source program) into machine level language (object program). Since it is difficult and incontinent to write a program in machine level language, language developer uses several assemblies and high level language which are not directly understood by the computer. Hence, we use different types of language processor to convert and make machine understandable. There are different types of language translators.</p>

  <div class="subsection">
  <h3>Assembler</h3>
  <p>These language translator/processor converts program written in assembly level language (source program) into machine understandable language (object language) Since assembly level language are closer to machine level language, the conversion taken by assembler is relatively less. It converts program at once into machine level language.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="subsection">
  <h3>Compiler</h3>
  <p>Those language processors which helps to convert program written in high level language (source program) into machine level program (object program). It converts whole program into machine level language at once. It is the largest method of translating a program in which debugging is complex and time consuming. Programming languages like C, C++, Java, etc. use complier</p>
  </div>

  <div class="subsection">
  <h3>Interpreter</h3>
  <p>This is the type of language which converts program written in high level language (source program) into machine level language (object program). It converts one statement at a time so its debugging can be easier and less time consuming. Its program execution is slower than that of compiler. Most of the new programming language use interpreter which allocate less memory space. Programs like BASIC, C#, Php, etc. use interpreter for conversion.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="subsection">
  <h3>Difference between compiler and interpreter</h3>

  <h2>Syntax and Semantics</h2>
  <p>As we know programming language helps the user to communicate with the computer. User is governing by several set of codes which instruct computer to perform some specific task. This set of codes and its structure is known as <strong>syntax</strong>. In addition, <strong>semantics</strong> is the meaning attached to individual word or symbol in programming language. For example:</p>
  <p>In q basic:</p>
  <pre><code>Print” This is programming”; P</code></pre>
  <p>Here, <strong>Print</strong> is Semantics and whole line is Structure (syntax)</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
  <h2>Error (BUG)</h2>
  <p>There may be several errors inside a program which stops program from being executed. Thus, an error in a program is known as a <strong>bug</strong>. This type of error in a program may arise by not following proper rules given by the programming language due to poor problem analysis or maybe due to hardware failure. Error in the program may five ambiguous (not accepted/false) result. The process of removing error from a computer program is known as <strong>debugging</strong>. There are three types of error:</p>

  <div class="subsection">
  <h3>Syntax error</h3>
  <p>the error which may arise due to not following proper rules or format given by the programming language. Every programming language have their own vocabulary, punctuation and structure. Programmers need to follow every detail while programming. This type of error can be detected by language processor such as compilers and interpreter. For e.g. In C, every statement should end with semi-colon at the end of the statement then the errors encounter is syntax error.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="subsection">
  <h3>Logical error</h3>
  <p><strong>Logic</strong> refers to idea or concept used to solve a specific problem. If the problem is poorly understood than it may hamper while solving the problem. The error that is encountered due to poorly developed logic is called <strong>logical error</strong>. This type of error is not detected by language processor. For example: In order to calculate simple interest, we use the formula I =(P*T*R)/100, if we write above mentioned formula, as I=P*T*R, then the error encounter is logical error.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="subsection">
  <h3>Runtime error</h3>
  <p>When a program is running or executing, it is said to be <strong>runtime</strong>. Hence, the error that are encounters/found while program is being executed is known as <strong>runtime error</strong>. It is also not detected by language translator. For example: if insufficient memory space, peripheral device not turning on.</p>
  </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
  <h2>Some common terminology in programming</h2>

  <div class="subsection">
  <h3>Data types</h3>
  <p>It specifies the type of data to be used in a program. Some common types of data types are:</p>
  <div class="subsection">
  <h4>Numeric</h4>
  <p>It is the combination of all the positive and negative whole number including zero.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
  <h4>Character</h4>

  </div>
  </div>

  <div class="subsection">
  <h3>Variable and Constant</h3>
  <div class="subsection">
  <h4>Variable</h4>
  <p>Those entities which holds either numeric or alphanumeric values and changes its value throughout the time of program execution.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
  <h4>Constant</h4>
  <p>Those entities which holds either numeric or alphanumeric values but does not change its value throughout the time of program execution.</p>
  </div>
  </div>

  <div class="subsection">
  <h3>Operands and Operators and Operations</h3>
  <p>Let us consider as;</p>
  <pre><code>S=A+B</code></pre>
  <p>Where S, A, B are operands<br>
  +, = are operands<br>
  S=A+B denotes sum of two operands A, B which is Operation</p>
  </div>

  <div class="subsection">
  <h3>Types of operators</h3>
  <p>It is a special symbol which helps to make operation successful i.e. it helps to make some specific operation.</p>
  <p>Commonly used operators are:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Arithmetic operators: +, -, /, *</li>
  <li>Relative operators: <, >, >=, <=, =</li>

  <h3>Algorithm</h3>
  <p>The step by step procedure or sequential steps for solving a specific problem is known as <strong>algorithm</strong>. Algorithm are written in simple English language and are not even close to any programming language.</p>
  <div class="subsection">
  <h4>Rules for writing algorithm:</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Algorithm should execute output after a finite step.</li>

  <p>The statement written in a single line and ended with the semicolon is simple statement. Eg. <code>printf (“My program”);</code></p>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
  <h4>Compound Statement</h4>
  <p>The group of simple statements grouped by the curly bracket open and close is the compound statement. Eg.</p>
  <pre><code>if (n>0)

  <h4>g) Escape Sequences</h4>
  <p>The symbol \ or ‘ is supposed as the <strong>Escape character</strong>. It means, the compiler of c programming language understands this character and the text after this to take as a special case. And the set of this symbol and the character behind it is known as the <strong>Escape Sequence</strong>. Some common escape sequences are:</p>
  <table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
  <th>Character</th><th>Escape</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr><td>New Line</td><td>\n</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Horizontal tab</td><td>\t</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Null character</td><td>\0</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Quotation mark</td><td>\"</td></tr>

  <h4>h) Operators (imp)</h4>
  <p>The symbols, which are used to operate on the operands for the mathematical and logical calculations are known as <strong>operators</strong>. C programming language has a rich set of built-in operators. Operator that requires two operands are binary (dyadic) operators, operators that require one operand is unary (monadic) and the operator that requires three operands is ternary operator. Eg. a+b, here + is an operator.</p>

  <h2>CONTROL STRUCTURE IN C (important)</h2>
  <p>Normally, the program execution flows top to the bottom lines of the programs. It means program executes one line after another. But sometime we need to execute other part of the programs or we need to divert the program flow from its normal execution. In such a case, we need some program statements, which are known as <strong>Control Structures</strong>. They are of three Types of control structure : a. sequence  b.selection and c. looping</p>

  <div class="subsection">
  <h3>A) Sequence</h3>
  <p>Program generally flows from top left top right bottom.</p>
  <div class="subsection">
