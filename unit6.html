  <h2>Introduction to the Internet</h2>
  <p><strong>Internet</strong> is the global network of networks. Or it is huge collection of computers all over the world that is inter-connected to one another in various ways to form a web-net.</p>

  <div class="subsection">
  <h3>Components required for Internet Connections</h3>
  <p>The basic requirements Internet are:</p>
  <ol type="a">
  <li>A <strong>TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)</strong> enabled computer with web browser.</li>
  <li>An account with an <strong>ISP (Internet Service Provider)</strong></li>
  <li>A telephone line</li>
  <li>A <strong>MODEM</strong> to connect to the telephone line and computer</li>
  <li>A set of computer: The capacity of computer should be as follow:
  <ul>
  <li>Minimum 386 microprocessor chip with 16 MB RAM</li>

  <h3>Internet Services and Applications</h3>
  <ol type="a">
  <li><strong>World Wide Web (WWW):</strong> <p>WWW is a series of services that are interconnected through hypertext. It provides link in the web document. It is the most important services provided by the Internet. It was created in 1990 European Particle Physics Laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland to exchange and share data through the Internet using the protocol known as <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</strong>.</p></li>
  <li><strong>Web Browser:</strong> <p>A web browser is a computer program that accesses web pages and displays them on computer screen. Or web browser is client software that allows the users to display and interact with a web page. It is the basic software that is needed to find, retrieve (open), view, send and receive information over the Internet. Without these web browser we cannot open WWW. Internet Explorer, Safari, Mozilla Firebox, Opera, Depnet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, Mosaic, etc. are some popular web browsers.</p></li>
  <li><strong>FTP - File Transfer Protocol:</strong> <p>It is an Internet tool that permits an Internet user to move or transfer a file from one computer to another. The files may have data, graphics, text, etc.</p></li>
  <li><strong>Electronic Mail (E-mail):</strong> <p>Sending and receiving messages electronically through the Internet is called E-mail. It is most widely used feature on the Internet. E-mail messages include a variety of digital text, graphics, video, animation, and audio data.</p></li>
  <li><strong>Voicemail:</strong> <p>Voicemail is a service offered by specialized computer hardware and software that answers telephone calls and records audio messages. We can talk to people using voicemail in easy way.</p></li>
  <li><strong>USENET – View and News:</strong> <p>View and News or USENET is the <strong>BBS (Bulletin Board Service)</strong> of Internet. The messages in this BBS are organized into thousands of News groups, which cover specific areas of Internet.</p></li>
  <li><strong>Chat:</strong> <p>Chat is a special feature provided by Internet to communicate with each other by typing in real time. A user can log-on into any chatting room and can connect with any person who is online. It is very easy way to exchange our ideas, feelings, information each other. The facility of offline message is also provided here, if your friend is not online.</p></li>
  <li><strong>IRC:</strong> <p><strong>Internet Relay Chat (IRC)</strong> is a huge multi-user live chat facility. There are a number of major IRC servers around the world, which are linked to each other. Anyone can create a channel and all others in the channel see anything that anyone types in a given channel.</p></li>
  <li><strong>Video Conferencing:</strong> <p>It is known as web cam chatting these days. This Video Conferencing uses the same technology as IRC but also provides sound and video pictures. It enables direct face-to-face communication across networks. It also provides real-time visual communications (online chat).</p></li>
  <li><strong>Universal Resource Locator (URL):</strong> <p>URL is a unique address that identifies its location on the Internet. Web browsers utilize the URL to retrieve a file from the computer on which it resides. The format of the URL is given below:</p>
  <pre><code>http         -  protocol
 www          -  host computer name
 animalplanet   -  domain name
 com          -  domain type</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li><strong>E-Fax (Electronic Fax):</strong> <p>It is another facility available in the Internet to send and receive faxes directly on our computer. It is very same of E-mail. The E-Fax message first goes to the Internet server, then the Internet server sends it to its destination whereas E-mail message goes to the local file server.</p>
  <div class="subsection">
  <h4>Q. Difference between E-mail and E-Fax</h4>

  <td>3. Message directly goes to print in the printer of the designation (destination) computer.</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>
  </div>
  </li>
  <li><strong>TELNET – Remote Login:</strong> <p>Telnet allows users to login to a host computer from a remote computer using a telnet program. In other words, it gives the user the opportunity to be on one computer system and work on another computer system, which may be across the street or thousands of miles away.</p></li>
  <li><strong>Navigators – Information Servers:</strong> <p>These are special features of Internet to discover, locate, and retrieve information on various objects. Some of the well-known utilities are Gopher, Archie, Hytelnet, WAIS, and WWW. The WWW navigator is the most popular and has resulted in the massive growth of Internet resources.</p></li>

  <h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>
  <p><strong>HTML</strong> stands for <strong>Hyper Text Markup Language</strong> which are used to create web pages that are used in internet to exchange data and information. HTML file itself is a text file which contains several tags and attributes. HTML was develop by Tim Berner Lee that was based on <strong>SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language)</strong>. The tags and attributes used to create HTML file are displayed using web browser. Web browser helps to understand all the tags and attributes given by the user and generate the contain of the page. The different version of HTML are: HTML, HTML+, HTML 1.0, HTML2.0, HTML3.2, HTML 4.01 and now HTML 5.0.</p>

  <div class="note">
  <p>Note: HTML tags and attributes are not case sensitive.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="subsection">
  <h4>a. Pair tag</h4>
  <p><strong>Pair tag</strong>: Those tags which have both opening and closing tags are known as pair tag. They are also known as container tags. If a tag is written only within the angular brackets <code>&lt;&gt;</code> then it is known as opening tag. Whereas, same tag is written within a angular bracket preceded by slash <code>/</code> then it is known as closing tag.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="subsection">

  <h2>DBMS (Database Management System)</h2>
  <div class="subsection">
  <h3>Data</h3>
  <p><strong>Data</strong> are the raw facts and figures. Data are isolated, uninterpreted and doesn't give any sense unless and until they are processed. Simply, they are the entities collected from the random world which under goes for processing. For eg, Ram,19,12,Pokhara</p>
  </div>

  <div class="subsection">
  <h3>Information</h3>
  <p><strong>Information</strong> are the meaningful result which are obtain after processing and gives some meaning and sense. Generally, It is a processed version of data. For eg, Ram is a student whose age is 19, he lives in Pokhara-12.</p>
  <p>As we know, information are obtain after processing data. Hence, we need <strong>data processing</strong> for converting data into information. Therefor, systematic and scientific arrangement and organization of data so that, we can retrieve it whenever require quickly and easily is called <strong>database</strong>. <strong>Database</strong> is organized collection of data for converting data and information so that it can give some meaningful result. For eg, Dictionary, Mark ledger, Census, Telephone directory etc.</p>
  <p>Since, manual collection and organization of data is time consuming, unsecured and complex, there is an application program which helps to maintain database i.e. systematic and scientific organization and collection of data. so, we can retrieve any piece of information within a fraction of time without any effort. Hence, the software or system built to fulfill the above requirement is known as <strong>database management system</strong>. In other word, it is a collection of software that manages data stored in database. The main purpose of DBMS is to store data, process them and obtain desired information. For Eg, Ms-Access, My-SQL, Oracle, Fox pro, dBase.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="subsection">
  <h3>Advantages/features/importance of DBMS</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>It allows user to search quickly and easily.</li>
  <li>It helps to reduce data redundancy(repetition)</li>
  <li>It allows user to share data over a network.</li>
  <li>It helps in data security and privacy,</li>
  <li>It improves data inconsistency(variance).</li>
  <li>It provides an organized way of storing data.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="subsection">
  <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Installation and operating cost is higher.</li>
  <li>It requires more disk space.</li>
  <li>It may sometime have security and privacy issue.</li>
  <li>Technical manpower (DBA) required to maintain and operate.</li>
  </ul>
